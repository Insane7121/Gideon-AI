## CONCLUSION
THERE ARE MANY PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET THAT CAN HELP THE USERS IN THEIR WORK. HOWEVER, THE SUCCESS RATE DEPENDS ON HOW THE APP IS EASY TO USE AND THEREFORE ONE CAN EASILY PENETRATE THE MARKET WITH THE PERFECT PRODUCT. YOUR APP SHOULD BE USER FRIENDLY PLUS, IT SHOULD HAVE NEW UPDATES EVERY NOW AND THEN TO GET THE USER REQUIRED OUTPUT. JUST MAKE SURE TO HAVE A BEST CODING COMPANY THAT CAN GROW THE APP AND PENETRATE THE MARKET.
